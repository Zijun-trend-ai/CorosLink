## [0.1.11] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **YouTube Playlists** — connect with Google OAuth credentials, browse your playlists, and queue tracks for download
- **YouTube Music** — sync playlists and liked songs by pasting DevTools headers (requires Python 3 + ytmusicapi)
- **Apple Music** — browse library playlists via pasted amp-api headers; tracks resolve to YouTube for download
- **Connect helper images** — visual DevTools guides for YouTube Music and Apple Music header setup
- Shared **SelectDropdown** component for consistent media UI pickers

### Fixed

- Windows auto-update artifacts aligned with release verification in CI

## [0.1.10] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Maps (BETA)** — browse official COROS v5 map regions, download/cache packages locally, and install to the watch over USB with live copy progress
- **Route builder** — generate loop or point-to-point GPX routes via OpenRouteService with interactive map preview, route stats, GPX export, and **Share to phone** (QR + local HTTP hand-off)
- **Batch map transfer** — select multiple cached maps and install them in one job with a single continuous progress bar
- **Cancel map transfer** — stop an in-progress watch map install; files already copied remain on the watch
- **Activity pace baselines** from stored Training Hub activities for route time estimates
- Local persistence of Training Hub activities in SQLite for offline analytics
- Weekly activity aggregation and expanded daily metrics parsing for Training Hub charts

### Changed

- README and overview copy now describe CorosLink as a COROS watch companion (not Pace Pro–only) with Maps and Route builder screenshots
- Training Hub fitness trend, heatmap, and scores panel polish

## [0.1.9] - 2026-06-28

### Changed

- Personal Records panel always shows elevation gain, half marathon, and marathon slots (with "Not recorded" when empty)
- Removed Best Pace, 1 Mile, and 2 Mile from Personal Records

### Fixed

- 5K personal record time now matches COROS Training Hub by preferring API type 5 and the validated `duration` field instead of partial type 10 segments

### Added

- In-app auto-updates via `electron-updater` (GitHub Releases)

- Training Hub **activity detail** split layout with inline route map, elevation chart, and GPS track fallback from GPX
- Training **heatmap** panel for activity frequency
- Richer parsing for personal records, race predictor, and upcoming workouts

### Changed

- Training Hub activity list and detail panels share a split view for faster browsing
- yt-dlp sync reuses already-downloaded files instead of re-downloading

### Fixed
