<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/spotify.png" alt="Spotify sync" width="900" />
</p>

#### YouTube Playlists

Sync your YouTube channel playlists with Google OAuth.

- **Google OAuth login** with your own Google Cloud OAuth credentials
- **Browse your playlists** and queue individual tracks for download
- **Background download queue** with live progress

#### YouTube Music

Sync your YouTube Music library by pasting request headers from your browser.

- **Header-based connect** — copy a `browse` request from DevTools on music.youtube.com (visual guide in-app)

- **Queue tracks** to download and transfer to your watch
- Requires **Python 3.10+** and **`ytmusicapi`** (`python3 -m pip install ytmusicapi`)

#### Apple Music

Browse your Apple Music library playlists and queue tracks for download.

- **Header-based connect** — copy an `amp-api` request from DevTools on music.apple.com (visual guide in-app)
- **Library playlists** load automatically when `media-user-token` is included
- **Tracks resolve via YouTube search** — Apple Music streams are DRM-protected, so downloads use the same YouTube matching flow as Spotify sync

---

### Maps — Watch maps and routes (BETA)

Download official COROS map regions and build custom GPX routes from your desktop.

#### Official map packages

Browse, cache, and install COROS map data to your watch over USB.

- **Search and filter** regions; download and cache packages locally
- **Watch storage panel** — maps vs other usage and free space at a glance
- **Install to watch** over USB with live copy progress
- **Choose a local map folder** for cached packages on your computer

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/map.png" alt="COROS map packages and watch install" width="900" />
</p>

#### Route builder

Generate GPX routes and send them to your phone for import into the COROS app.

- **Generate loop or point-to-point routes** with an OpenRouteService API key
- **Sport presets** — running, walking, hiking, road cycling, and mountain biking — plus elevation preference
- **Interactive map preview** with start pin, fit route, and layer themes
- **Route stats** — distance, estimated time and pace, ascent/descent, and elevation profile
- **Export GPX** and **Share to phone** (QR) for import into the COROS mobile app's route library

Direct cloud upload to your COROS account is not wired yet; GPX export via the phone app is the supported path today.

## How it works

CorosLink uses independent data paths — USB for watch files, OpenRouteService for routes, and COROS APIs for training.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  YouTube --> ytDlp[yt-dlp + ffmpeg]
  Spotify --> ytDlp
  YouTubeMusic[YouTube Music] --> ytDlp
  AppleMusic[Apple Music] --> ytDlp
  YouTubePlaylists[YouTube Playlists] --> ytDlp
  ytDlp --> SQLite[(Local SQLite)]
  SQLite --> USBMusic[USB Music folder]
  MapCDN[map-oss-us.coros.com] --> MapCache[Local map cache]
  MapCache --> USBMaps[USB map folder]

  USBMusic --> Watch[COROS watch]
  USBMaps --> Watch
  GPX --> PhoneApp[COROS phone app]
  COROSAccount[COROS account] --> TeamAPI[teamapi.coros.com]
  TeamAPI --> Dashboard[Training Hub]
```

**Music sync** does not use an official COROS SDK. The app detects your watch when it mounts as a USB drive with a `Music` folder, then copies MP3 files directly.

**Map install** downloads official packages from COROS map servers, caches them locally, and copies them to your watch's map folder over USB.

**Route builder** calls OpenRouteService to generate a route, then exports GPX for import through the COROS phone app (Bluetooth sync to the watch).

**Training Hub** authenticates with COROS team APIs to fetch your analytics, activities, and fitness scores. Credentials are sent to COROS servers at login; all other app data stays on your machine.

## Install

### Download

Get the latest installer from **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/releases)**:

| Platform              | File                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `CorosLink-*-arm64.dmg`       |
| Windows               | `CorosLink Setup *.exe`       |
| Linux (x64)           | `CorosLink-*-x86_64.AppImage` |

#### macOS: “app is damaged” or won’t open

The app is **not** corrupted. macOS blocks unsigned apps downloaded from the internet. Fix it after installing:

```sh
xattr -cr "/Applications/CorosLink.app"
```

Then open normally. If that still fails, right-click the app → **Open** → **Open** again.

> Builds are unsigned (no Apple Developer certificate). A future signed release would skip this step.

Windows may show a SmartScreen prompt for unsigned installers — click **More info** → **Run anyway**.

On Linux, download the AppImage, mark it executable (`chmod +x CorosLink-*.AppImage`), then run it. Most desktop environments can also open AppImages directly from the file manager.

### In-app updates

Packaged builds check **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/releases)** for new versions on launch. When an update is available, CorosLink downloads it in the background and shows **Restart to update** in the header. You can also click the version badge to check manually.

> **macOS note:** Auto-update works best with signed builds. Unsigned installs may still need a manual download from GitHub Releases until code signing is set up.

> **First release with in-app updates:** Users on v0.1.7 or earlier must install manually once. After that, updates arrive in-app.

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink.git
cd CorosLink
npm install
npm run rebuild
npm run dist:mac    # macOS DMG (run on macOS)
npm run dist:win    # Windows NSIS installer (run on Windows)
npm run dist:linux  # Linux AppImage (run on Linux)
```

Installers are written to `release/`.

### Requirements

- **macOS**, **Windows**, or **Linux**
- **USB cable** to connect your COROS watch for music and map sync
- **yt-dlp** and **ffmpeg** — bundled in packaged builds; falls back to `PATH` if missing
- **OpenRouteService API key** (optional) — only needed for Route Builder
- **Spotify Developer app** (optional) — only needed for Spotify playlist sync
- **Google Cloud OAuth app** (optional) — only needed for YouTube Playlists sync
- **Python 3.10+** and **ytmusicapi** (optional) — only needed for YouTube Music library sync
- **COROS account** (optional) — only needed for Training Hub

---

## Privacy and data

- **Music and downloads** — stored locally in the Electron user data directory (SQLite database + MP3 files on disk)
- **Spotify tokens** — stored locally in SQLite after OAuth; never sent anywhere except Spotify
- **Google OAuth tokens** — stored locally in SQLite after OAuth; used only for YouTube Data API playlist reads
- **YouTube Music / Apple Music headers** — stored locally and used only to read your library metadata; never sent to CorosLink servers
- **Map cache** — downloaded map packages are stored in a local folder you choose; copied to the watch over USB only
- **OpenRouteService** — route requests are sent to OpenRouteService when you generate a route (your API key is stored locally)
- **Training Hub** — your COROS email and password are used to authenticate with COROS servers. Activity data is fetched on demand and not synced to any third-party service
- **No cloud sync** — the app does not run its own backend or upload your files

> Only download media you have the rights or permission to download.

## Development

<details>
<summary><strong>Development setup</strong></summary>

```sh
npm install
npm run rebuild
npm run binaries:prepare
npm run dev
```

The dev command starts Vite at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` and launches Electron. `npm run rebuild` prepares native SQLite bindings for Electron. `npm run dev` automatically runs `binaries:prepare` before Electron starts, downloading the pinned `yt-dlp` release and copying the `ffmpeg-static` binary into `bin/<platform>-<arch>/`. You can also run `binaries:prepare` manually if you only need to refresh media tools.

To prepare Windows x64 media binaries from any platform:

```sh
npm run binaries:prepare:win
```

To prepare Linux x64 media binaries from any platform:

```sh
npm run binaries:prepare:linux
```

For hardware-free watch detection checks, set `COROS_WATCH_PATH=/path/to/mock-watch` with a `Music` folder, or run:

```sh
npm run smoke:watch
```

To regenerate README screenshots:

```sh
npm run build:electron
./node_modules/.bin/electron scripts/capture-readme-screenshots.cjs
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Spotify Developer setup</strong></summary>

Create a free Spotify app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard), then add this redirect URI exactly:

```text
https://127.0.0.1:4567/callback
```

Paste the app's Client ID and Client Secret into the Spotify Sync view. The app opens a local OAuth login window and stores the resulting token locally in SQLite.

Playlist sync reads the authenticated user's playlists and only enables playlists that Spotify allows the user to read — currently playlists the user owns or collaborates on. Each track is searched on YouTube as `<artist> <track> official audio`, downloaded as an MP3, and saved as `Artist - Track Name.mp3`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>YouTube Playlists setup</strong></summary>

Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (Desktop app or Web application), enable the **YouTube Data API v3**, then add this redirect URI exactly:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4568
```

Paste the Client ID and Client Secret into the YouTube Playlists view, then connect. The app opens a local OAuth login window and stores tokens locally in SQLite.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>YouTube Music setup</strong></summary>

Install Python 3.10+ and ytmusicapi:

```sh
python3 -m pip install ytmusicapi
```

Open [music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com/library) while signed in, open DevTools (F12), go to the **Network** tab, filter for `browse`, right-click a **POST** request, and choose **Copy → Copy as cURL**. Paste the command into CorosLink and connect. Headers must include `cookie` and `x-goog-authuser`. They expire when you sign out of YouTube Music in your browser — re-paste if syncing stops.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Apple Music setup</strong></summary>

Open [music.apple.com](https://music.apple.com) while signed in, open DevTools (F12), go to the **Network** tab, filter for `amp-api`, right-click any request, and choose **Copy → Copy as cURL**. Paste into CorosLink and connect. The `authorization` bearer token is required; include `media-user-token` for personal library playlists. Tokens expire often — re-paste if fetching stops working.

Apple Music streams are DRM-protected. CorosLink reads playlist metadata from Apple and resolves each track via YouTube search for download (same approach as Spotify sync).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Packaging</strong></summary>

```sh
npm run dist
```

Before packaging, run `npm run binaries:prepare`. The packaged app checks bundled binaries first, then falls back to `PATH`.

Convenience target scripts:

```sh
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:win
npm run dist:linux
```

For a quick local packaging layout check without code signing:

```sh
CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false npm run dist -- --dir
```

Because `better-sqlite3` is native, build Windows installers on Windows or in CI where Electron native dependencies can be rebuilt for the Windows target. The same applies to Linux AppImages on Linux.

**Publishing a release (maintainers):**

1. Prepare the version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` so they match the tag you are about to create:

```sh
npm run release:prepare -- v0.1.5
git commit -am "chore: release v0.1.5"
git tag v0.1.5
git push origin main v0.1.5
```

2. That triggers the [Release installers](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow. CI syncs the tag into `package.json` before building, then verifies the versions match, so installer names like `CorosLink-0.1.5-arm64.dmg` always follow the git tag. The workflow also uploads `latest-mac.yml`, `latest-linux.yml`, and `latest.yml` plus macOS/Windows blockmaps so packaged apps can auto-update via `electron-updater` (Linux AppImage embeds its blockmap in the file). Each platform build runs `scripts/verify-release-artifacts.mjs` and fails if update metadata is missing.

You can also run the workflow manually from **Actions → Release installers** (it uses the current `package.json` version when no tag is pushed).

Pushes to `main` run [Build desktop installers](.github/workflows/build.yml) and upload CI artifacts for testing before tagging.

**Verify release artifacts locally:**

```sh
npm run dist:mac    # or dist:win / dist:linux on the matching OS
npm run release:verify-artifacts -- macos
```

After building, confirm `release/latest-mac.yml` (or `latest.yml` / `latest-linux.yml`) exists and that the packaged app contains `app-update.yml` with the GitHub publish config.

**Test auto-update end-to-end (maintainers):**

1. Tag and ship a baseline release that includes the updater (e.g. v0.1.8).
2. Install that build from GitHub Releases on a test machine.
3. Confirm the header shows a clickable version badge (not dev-only text).
4. Tag and ship a newer release (e.g. v0.1.9).
5. In the older app, wait ~5 seconds or click the version badge.
6. Expect: checking → update available → downloading → **Restart to update**.
7. Click restart; the app should relaunch on the new version.

**Windows** should complete this flow unsigned. **macOS unsigned** may download updates but fail to install on restart until code signing is configured — use manual download as fallback on Mac until then.
