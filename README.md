## How it works

COROS Desktop uses two independent data paths — USB for music, COROS APIs for training.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  YouTube --> ytDlp[yt-dlp + ffmpeg]
  Spotify --> ytDlp
  ytDlp --> SQLite[(Local SQLite)]
  SQLite --> USB[USB Music folder]
  USB --> Watch[COROS Pace Pro]
  COROSAccount[COROS account] --> TeamAPI[teamapi.coros.com]
  TeamAPI --> Dashboard[Training Hub]
```

**Music sync** does not use an official COROS SDK. The app detects your watch when it mounts as a USB drive with a `Music` folder, then copies MP3 files directly.

**Training Hub** authenticates with COROS team APIs to fetch your analytics, activities, and fitness scores. Credentials are sent to COROS servers at login; all other app data stays on your machine.

## Install

### Download pre-built installers

**Option A — GitHub Releases (recommended for users)**

1. Push your code and create a release tag:
   ```sh
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```
2. The [Release installers](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow builds both platforms and publishes a GitHub Release with:
   - **macOS** — `COROS Desktop-0.1.0-arm64.dmg`
   - **Windows** — `COROS Desktop Setup 0.1.0.exe`

You can also trigger the same workflow manually from **Actions → Release installers → Run workflow**.

**Option B — CI artifacts (before tagging a release)**

After a push to `main`, download installers from the [Build desktop installers](.github/workflows/build.yml) workflow artifacts:

| Platform | Artifact name | Format |
| -------- | ------------- | ------ |
| macOS | `coros-desktop-macos` | `.dmg` |
| Windows | `coros-desktop-windows` | `.exe` (NSIS) |

**Option C — Build locally**

```sh
npm install
npm run rebuild
npm run dist:mac    # macOS DMG (run on macOS)
npm run dist:win    # Windows NSIS installer (run on Windows)
```

Installers are written to `release/`. macOS builds are unsigned by default — users may need to right-click → Open the first time. Windows builds are unsigned NSIS installers.

### Requirements

- **macOS** or **Windows**
- **USB cable** to connect your Pace Pro for music sync
- **yt-dlp** and **ffmpeg** — bundled in packaged builds; falls back to `PATH` if missing
- **Spotify Developer app** (optional) — only needed for Spotify playlist sync
- **COROS account** (optional) — only needed for Training Hub

---

## Privacy and data

- **Music and downloads** — stored locally in the Electron user data directory (SQLite database + MP3 files on disk)
- **Spotify tokens** — stored locally in SQLite after OAuth; never sent anywhere except Spotify
- **Training Hub** — your COROS email and password are used to authenticate with COROS servers. Activity data is fetched on demand and not synced to any third-party service
- **No cloud sync** — the app does not run its own backend or upload your files

> Only download media you have the rights or permission to download.

## Development

<details>
<summary><strong>Development setup</strong></summary>

```sh
npm install
npm run rebuild
npm run binaries:prepare
npm run dev
```

The dev command starts Vite at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` and launches Electron. `npm run rebuild` prepares native SQLite bindings for Electron. `npm run binaries:prepare` downloads the current platform's standalone `yt-dlp` release asset and copies the `ffmpeg-static` binary into `bin/<platform>-<arch>/`.

To prepare Windows x64 media binaries from any platform:

```sh
npm run binaries:prepare:win
```

For hardware-free watch detection checks, set `COROS_WATCH_PATH=/path/to/mock-watch` with a `Music` folder, or run:

```sh
npm run smoke:watch
```

To regenerate README screenshots:

```sh
npm run build:electron
./node_modules/.bin/electron scripts/capture-readme-screenshots.cjs
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Spotify Developer setup</strong></summary>

Create a free Spotify app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard), then add this redirect URI exactly:

```text
https://127.0.0.1:4567/callback
```

Paste the app's Client ID and Client Secret into the Spotify Sync view. The app opens a local OAuth login window and stores the resulting token locally in SQLite.

Playlist sync reads the authenticated user's playlists and only enables playlists that Spotify allows the user to read — currently playlists the user owns or collaborates on. Each track is searched on YouTube as `<artist> <track> official audio`, downloaded as an MP3, and saved as `Artist - Track Name.mp3`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Packaging</strong></summary>

```sh
npm run dist
```

Before packaging, run `npm run binaries:prepare`. The packaged app checks bundled binaries first, then falls back to `PATH`.

Convenience target scripts:

```sh
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:win
```

For a quick local packaging layout check without code signing:

```sh
CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false npm run dist -- --dir
```

Because `better-sqlite3` is native, build Windows installers on Windows or in CI where Electron native dependencies can be rebuilt for the Windows target.

The included GitHub Actions workflow builds and uploads the macOS DMG on `macos-latest` and the Windows NSIS installer on `windows-latest`.
